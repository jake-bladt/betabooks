## Notes

### 24-Nov-2019 - A General Braindump, Presaging The Shape of Things to Come

The premise of beta-my-book is that, as an author, I would like to be able to share a book I'm in the process of writing and editing with a select set of beta readers who can comment in real-time. I imagine it being like a git pull request for coders. The author puts up draft work for review. The readers review it and make comments both inline and in general. Some comments are suggested edits (ie, for typos) while others are more general feedback.
